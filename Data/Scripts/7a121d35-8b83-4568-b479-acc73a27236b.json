I'm still left with questions... Who is the one-eyed man? Why did he bring me here of all places? I'll file solving this mystery under \"Things to Do.\"\n\nOn the other hand, my Patron - and Terk - wants me to spy on Gerhard and discredit him here at the school. I get that Terk despises Gerhard, but what does my Patron have against him? One more mystery for me to solve."
